# EngiCalc

EngiCalc is a Python package designed to assist engineers in performing frequent calculations more efficiently. It aims to replace Excel in the daily workflow by providing easily readable calculation sheets in Jupyter Notebooks, which can then be output as Word files using Quarto. Python code is easier to check for errors, making it a more reliable choice for engineering calculations.

## Core Functionalities

### 1. Store Frequently Used Formulas
EngiCalc stores a collection of frequently used formulas in engineering calculations. This helps in reducing the redundancy of writing the same formulas repeatedly.

### 2. Seamless Integration with Jupyter Notebooks
EngiCalc is intended to be used within Jupyter Notebooks. This allows engineers to create detailed and easily readable calculation sheets that can be reviewed, shared, and modified with ease.

### 3. Output as Word Files Using Quarto
Once the calculations are complete, they can be output as Word files using Quarto. This feature ensures that the final reports are professional and ready for documentation or presentation purposes.
