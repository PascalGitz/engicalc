# EngiCalc


EngiCalc is a Python package designed to assist engineers in performing
frequent calculations more efficiently. It aims to replace Excel in the
daily workflow by providing easily readable calculation sheets in
Jupyter Notebooks, which can then be output as Word files using Quarto.
Python code is easier to check for errors, making it a more reliable
choice for engineering calculations. The functionality of the package is shown in the [Example](tests/Functionality.pdf).

## Installation

You can install EngiCalc using `pip install engicalcs`.
